# Fine-Tuning-LLMs-for-Ollama
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune open-source language models with custom data and then run them locally using Ollama .  It uses Google Colab for training (leveraging free GPUs) and integrates the trained model into Ollama for local inference.
üîë What is Fine-Tuning?

Fine-tuning takes a pre-trained model (like LLaMA, Mistral, etc.) and adapts it to your specific task or domain.
Examples:

Extracting structured data from HTML

Customer support conversations

Domain-specific knowledge (legal, medical, etc.)

Benefits:

Requires fewer examples than training from scratch

Produces specialized models for better accuracy in your use case

Can reduce costs by using smaller models

‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

Prepare Data

Collect examples in JSON format (input ‚Üí expected output).

Example: extracting product name, price, category from HTML snippets.

Set Up Training in Google Colab

Upload your dataset.

Install dependencies.

Load a base model (small models recommended for speed).

Preprocess data into prompt ‚Üí output format.

Fine-Tune with LoRA Adapters

Apply adapters to enable efficient training.

Use the SFTTrainer to run training.

Test the Model in Colab

Run inference on sample prompts.

Verify outputs match expected format.

Export the Model

Save the fine-tuned model in .gguf format.

Download the file to your local machine.

Integrate with Ollama

Create a Model File (defines base model, parameters, and templates).

Use ollama create -f ModelFile <model-name> to register the model.

Run with ollama run <model-name>.

üìÇ Example Files

Dataset JSON ‚Äì input/output pairs for fine-tuning.

Training Notebook ‚Äì step-by-step Colab script.

Model File ‚Äì Ollama configuration for your trained model.

üöÄ Quick Start

Clone/download the project.

Open the provided notebook in Google Colab.

Upload your dataset and run training.

Export the .gguf model file.

Create a Model File in Ollama.

Run your fine-tuned model locally!

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

Use a small dataset + small model for quick experiments.

More data = better results (but longer training).

Fine-tuned models are better at your task, but worse at general tasks.
